\section{Problem 1-Conclusion}


In Part A, as expected the distance traveled moves both in the positive and negative directions since the random walker moves both in the positive and negative directions.

In Part B, the results show that the relationship between distance traveled squared and time is linear. These results also show that the distance traveled square increases as time increases.
